	abstract = {There is growing physical and mathematical interest in the hydrodynamics of dissipationless/dispersive media. Since G.B. Whitham’s seminal publication fifty years ago that ushered in the mathematical study of dispersive hydrodynamics, there has been a significant body of work in this area. However, there has been no comprehensive survey of the field of dispersive hydrodynamics. Utilizing Whitham’s averaging theory as the primary mathematical tool, we review the rich mathematical developments over the past fifty years with an emphasis on physical applications. The fundamental, large scale, coherent excitation in dispersive hydrodynamic systems is an expanding, oscillatory dispersive shock wave or {DSW}. Both the macroscopic and microscopic properties of {DSWs} are analyzed in detail within the context of the universal, integrable, and foundational models for uni-directional (Korteweg–de Vries equation) and bi-directional (Nonlinear Schrödinger equation) dispersive hydrodynamics. A {DSW} fitting procedure that does not rely upon integrable structure yet reveals important macroscopic {DSW} properties is described. {DSW} theory is then applied to a number of physical applications: superfluids, nonlinear optics, geophysics, and fluid dynamics. Finally, we survey some of the more recent developments including non-classical {DSWs}, {DSW} interactions, {DSWs} in perturbed and inhomogeneous environments, and two-dimensional, oblique {DSWs}.},

	abstract = {Dispersive shock waves and solitons are fundamental nonlinear excitations in dispersive media, but dispersive shock wave studies to date have been severely constrained. Here, we report on a novel dispersive hydrodynamic test bed: the effectively frictionless dynamics of interfacial waves between two high viscosity contrast, miscible, low Reynolds number Stokes fluids. This scenario is realized by injecting from below a lighter, viscous fluid into a column filled with high viscosity fluid. The injected fluid forms a deformable pipe whose diameter is proportional to the injection rate, enabling precise control over the generation of symmetric interfacial waves. Buoyancy drives nonlinear interfacial self-steepening, while normal stresses give rise to the dispersion of interfacial waves. Extremely slow mass diffusion and mass conservation imply that the interfacial waves are effectively dissipationless. This enables high fidelity observations of large amplitude dispersive shock waves in this spatially extended system, found to agree quantitatively with a nonlinear wave averaging theory. Furthermore, several highly coherent phenomena are investigated including dispersive shock wave backflow, the refraction or absorption of solitons by dispersive shock waves, and the multiphase merging of two dispersive shock waves. The complex, coherent, nonlinear mixing of dispersive shock waves and solitons observed here are universal features of dissipationless, dispersive hydrodynamic flows.},

The partial differential equation contains two parameters, n and m, which are the exponents in power laws relating, respectively, the permeability of the medium and the bulk and shear viscosities of the solid matrix to the voidage. It is proved that, for any value of m, rarefactive solitary wave solutions satisfying certain physically reasonable boundary conditions always exist if n{\textbackslash}textgreater1 but do not exist if 0⩽n⩽1. It is also proved that the speed of the solitary wave is an increasing function of the amplitude of the wave. Six new exact rarefactive solitary wave solutions, four of which are expressed in terms of elementary functions and two in terms of elliptic integrals, are derived for six sets of values of n and m. The large amplitude approximation is considered and the results of Scott and Stevenson for n{\textbackslash}textgreater2, m=0 and n{\textbackslash}textgreater1, m=1 are extended to n{\textbackslash}textgreater1 and all m⩾0.

	abstract = {The theory for waves on a buoyant fluid conduit in a more viscous outer fluid is extended to include a visco-elastic outer fluid. The external fluid is treated as a linear Kelvin-type visco-elastic medium and a wave evolution equation is derived. This equation is identical to the purely viscous case with the exception of a new term representing the elastic effects. A conservation law is derived and used in an analytic treatment for a slowly-varying solitary wave (given initially by the exact solution to the purely viscous case) for the case of small, but non-zero, elasticity. The theory shows that the wave amplitude will decay and a shelf. required for the conservation of mass, will develop behind the wave. Numerical solutions of the evolution equation support the analytic approximation. Laboratory experiments show qualitative agreement with the analytic and numerical development. Geophysical applications suggest that these effects may be most important for melt migration in the asthenosphere.},

	abstract = {The Korteweg – de Vries ({KdV}) equation is a fundamental mathemati- cal model for the description of weakly nonlinear long wave propagation in dispersive media. It is known to possess a number of families of exact analytic solutions. Two of them – solitons and nonlinear periodic travel- ling waves – are of particular interest from the viewpoint of ﬂuid dynamics applications as they occur as typical asymptotic outcomes in a broad class of initial/boundary-value problems. Two diﬀerent ma jor approaches have been developed in the last four decades to deal with the problems involv- ing solitons and nonlinear periodic waves: inverse scattering transform and the Whitham method of slow modulations. We review these methods and show the relations between them. Emphasis is made on solving the {KdV} equation with large-scale initial data. In this case, the long-time evolution leads to the formation of an expanding undular bore, a modulated travel- ling wave connecting two diﬀerent non-oscillating ﬂows. Another problem considered is the propagation of a solitary wave through a variable envi- ronment in the framework of the variable-coeﬃcient {KdV} equation. If the background environment varies slowly, the solitary wave deforms adiabati- cally and an extended small-amplitude trailing shelf is generated ensuring the conservation of mass. On a long-time scale, the trailing shelf evolves, via an intermediate stage of an undular bore, into a secondary soliton train.},

We study analytically and numerically the eigenvalues of the linearized {NLS}/{GP} equation. The dispersion relation for shallow solitons is obtained asymptotically beyond the {KP} limit. This yields (1) the maximal growth rate and associated wavenumber of unstable perturbations and (2) the separatrix between convective and absolute instabilities. The instability properties of the dark soliton are directly related to those of oblique dispersive shock wave ({DSW}) solutions. Stationary and nonstationary oblique {DSWs} are constructed analytically and investigated numerically by direct simulations of the {NLS}/{GP} equation. It is found that stationary and nonstationary oblique {DSWs} have the same jump conditions in the shallow and hypersonic regimes.

The graph of shocks grows and branches. Velocity and pressure have finite discontinuities across the shock. We formulate a few simple physical principles which single out the dispersive solution and interpret shocks as lines of decompressed fluid. We also formulate the dispersive weak solution in algebro-geometrical terms as an evolution of the Krichever-Boutroux complex curve. We study in detail the most generic (2, 3)-cusp singularity, which gives rise to an elementary branching event. This solution is self-similar and expressed in terms of elliptic functions.},

Various other initial conditions are discussed, including cases with linearly decreasing fluid content and with locally large (in relative terms) fluid content. The chemical evolution of the segregating fluid is also described.

	abstract = {A general theory is developed for studying changes of a wave train governed by non-linear partial differential equations. The technique is to average over the local oscillations in the medium and so obtain differential equations for the variations in amplitude, wave number, etc. It corresponds to the Krylov-Bogoliubov averaging technique for the ordinary differential equations of non-linear vibrations. The equations obtained in this way are hyperbolic and can be handled by the usual theory of quasi-linear hyperbolic systems, involving the theory of characteristics and shock waves. In this case the 'shocks' are abrupt changes in the amplitude, wave number, etc. They do not involve dissipation, but it turns out that frequency plays the role corresponding to entropy in ordinary gas dynamic shocks. It is not clear whether these shocks will really occur in practice. However, they have a number of interesting properties and seem to be relevant to the discussion of so-called collisionless shocks in plasma dynamics. The main applications envisaged are to water waves and plasma dynamics, and the theory is developed using typical equations from these areas. If the original equations are linear, this theory predicts the usual description of dispersive waves in terms of group velocity, so it may be considered as an extension of the group velocity concept to non-linear problems. Mathematically, the theory may be considered as an extension of some of the methods and ideas for the non-linear ordinary differential equations of vibration theory to partial differential equations.},

In the other case, a fast dispersive shock overtakes a slower one, giving rise to an interaction. Eventually the two merge into a single dispersive shock wave. In both cases, the interaction region is described by a modulated, quasi-periodic two-phase solution of the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation. The boundaries between the background density, dispersive shock waves and their interaction region are calculated by solving the Whitham modulation equations. These asymptotic results are in excellent agreement with full numerical simulations. It is further shown that the interactions of two dispersive shock waves have some qualitative similarities to the interactions of two classical shock waves.},

The first, an undular bore composed of cnoidal waves, is qualitatively similar to the bore found for the {KdV} equation, with solitons occurring at the leading edge and small amplitude linear waves occurring at the trailing edge. The second, a newly identified type of undular bore, consists of finite amplitude sinusiodal waves, which have a rational form. At the leading edge is the {mKdV} algebraic soliton, while, again, small amplitude linear waves occur at the trailing edge. The initial-boundary value ({IBV}) problem for the {mKdV} equation is also examined. The solutions of the initial value problem are used to construct approximate analytical solutions of the {IBV} problem. An alternative analytical solution for the {IBV} problem, based on the assumption of an uniform train of solitons, is also developed. The parameter regimes, in which the different types of solution occur, for both the initial value and {IBV} problem are identified and excellent comparisons are obtained between the numerical and approximate solutions, for both problems.},

The {NC}-{STO} resistance and microwave signal generation are measured simultaneously as a function of drive current and applied perpendicular magnetic field. Both exhibit dramatic transitions at a certain current dependent critical field value, where the microwave frequency drops 10 {GHz}, modulation sidebands appear, and the resistance exhibits a jump, while the magnetoresistance changes sign. We interpret these observations as the nucleation of a magnetic droplet soliton with a large fraction of its magnetization processing with an angle greater than 90°, i.e., around a direction opposite that of the applied field. This interpretation is corroborated by numerical simulations. When the field is further increased, we find that the droplet eventually collapses under the pressure from the Zeeman energy.},

Using a reduced version of the finite-gap integration method we derive the Gardner-Whitham modulation system in a Riemann invariant form and show that it can be mapped onto the well-known modulation system for the Korteweg‚Äìde Vries equation. The transformation between the two counterpart modulation systems is, however, not invertible. As a result, the study of the resolution of an initial discontinuity for the Gardner equation reveals a rich phenomenology of solutions which, along with the {KdV}-type simple undular bores, include nonlinear trigonometric bores, solibores, rarefaction waves, and composite solutions representing various combinations of the above structures.

	title = {Observation of dissipative droplet soliton in nano-contact spin-torque oscillator with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy free layer},
	abstract = {Existing of a droplet soliton excitation in nano-contact spin-torque oscillators ({STOs}) with large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ({PMA}) was predicted by Hoefer et al [Hoefer {PRB}] as a novel localized oscillating mode which has never seen yet in experiments. This mode is related to the dynamics of the “magnon droplet” pointing nearly opposite to its equilibrium direction. In this paper, we present the observation of novel localized dissipative droplet soliton mode in a nano-contact {STO}. Nano-contact diameter varies from 50 to 100 nm fabricated on an orthogonal spin valve with in-plane Co reference layer and {PMA} Co/Ni free layer separated by Cu, Co8/Cu/Co0.3[Ni0.8/Co0.4]x4, which thicknesses are given in nm. We have recently shown a high frequency operation at low field for this {STO} [{PSS} {RRL}], which confirm an existing of a large {PMA} free layer. We observed a linear dependent of {STO} frequency versus external field up to a moderate value, indicating small precession {STO} operation [{NIST} {PRB}]. Interestingly, at moderate field, there is an immediate drop, about 10 {GHz}, in frequency accompanying with a jump in resistance both observed in field and current sweeps. Observed signal has higher power than those with higher frequency mode. We show a relation between nano-contact size, droplet onset frequency, field and current and frequency drop which fit very well with theory. Our results are promising mechanism to get higher power of {STOs} and derive a new dynamics in nano-contact {STOs} which opens up many subjects for future studies.},

	abstract = {Magnetic dissipative droplets are localized, strongly nonlinear dynamical modes excited in nanocontact spin valves with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. These modes find potential application in nanoscale structures for magnetic storage and computation, but dissipative droplet studies have so far been limited to extended thin films. Here, numerical and asymptotic analyses are used to demonstrate the existence and properties of novel solitons in confined structures. As a nanowire’s width is decreased with a nanocontact of fixed size at its center, the observed modes undergo transitions from a fully localized two-dimensional droplet into a two-dimensional droplet edge mode and then a pulsating one-dimensional droplet. These solitons are interpreted as dissipative versions of classical, conservative solitons, allowing for an analytical description of the modes and the mechanisms of bifurcation. The presented results open up new possibilities for the study of low-dimensional solitons and droplet applications in nanostructures.},

The external fluid is treated as a linear Kelvin-type visco-elastic medium and a wave evolution equation is derived. This equation is identical to the purely viscous case with the exception of a new term representing the elastic effects. A conservation law is derived and used in an analytic treatment for a slowly-varying solitary wave (given initially by the exact solution to the purely viscous case) for the case of small, but non-zero, elasticity. The theory shows that the wave amplitude will decay and a shelf, required for the conservation of mass, will develop behind the wave. Numerical solutions of the evolution equation support the analytic approximation. Laboratory experiments show qualitative agreement with the analytic and numerical development. Geophysical applications suggest that these effects may be most important for melt migration in the asthenosphere.},

For typical {UFG} experimental conditions, the theoretical oscillation length scale is smaller than the resolution of present imaging systems so it is unclear how to determine the shock type from its structure alone. Two experimental methods to determine the appropriate regularization mechanism are proposed: measurement of the shock speed and observation of a one-dimensional collision experiment with sufficiently tight radial confinement.},

In equilibrium, this process produces a large number of particle-hole pairs, a phenomenon closely related to the orthogonality catastrophe.

Using spin transfer torque underneath a nanocontact on a magnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy ({PMA}), we have observed the generation of dissipative magnetic droplet solitons and report on their rich dynamical properties. Micromagnetic simulations identify a wide range of automodulation frequencies, including droplet oscillatory motion, droplet "spinning," and droplet "breather" states. The droplet can be controlled by using both current and magnetic fields and is expected to have applications in spintronics, magnonics, and {PMA}-based domain-wall devices. Magnetic Droplet When a solitary wave travels atop the surface of a fluid, its shape generally changes with time, with some of its components traveling at velocities slightly different than others. In nonlinear media, this spreading effect may be countered by a slimming effect stemming from the non-linearity, which generates an object with perfectly preserved shape, called a soliton. Solitons have been observed in fluids, granular media, and other systems. Mohseni et al. (p. 1295) detected a dissipative soliton (one that also balances gain and dissipation) in a magnetic system, in the form of a magnetic droplet consisting of a core of spins pointing opposite to the external magnetic field. The droplet exhibited peculiar dynamics and could be controlled by electric current.},

	abstract = {The evolution of the interface separating a conduit of light, viscous fluid rising buoyantly through a heavy, more viscous, exterior fluid at small Reynolds numbers is governed by the interplay between nonlinearity and dispersion. Previous authors have proposed an approximate model equation based on physical arguments, but a precise theoretical treatment for this two-fluid system with a free boundary is lacking. Here, a derivation of the interfacial equation via a multiple scales, perturbation technique is presented. Perturbations about a state of vertically uniform, laminar conduit flow are considered in the context of the Navier-Stokes equations with appropriate boundary conditions. The ratio of interior to exterior viscosities is the small parameter used in the asymptotic analysis, which leads systematically to a maximal balance between buoyancy driven, nonlinear self-steepening and viscous, interfacial stress induced, nonlinear dispersion. This results in a scalar, nonlinear partial differential equation describing large amplitude dynamics of the cross-sectional area of the intrusive fluid conduit, in agreement with previous derivations. The leading order behavior of the two-fluid system is completely characterized in terms of the interfacial dynamics. The regime of model validity is characterized and shown to agree with previous experimental studies. Viscous fluid conduits provide a robust setting for the study of nonlinear, dispersive wave phenomena.},

When the flow is slow enough, there are no waves and whirlpools formed around the obstacle, due to the spectacular phenomenon of superfluidity. For higher flow velocities, it has been predicted that the currents created by the obstacle give rise to a turbulent emission of quantised vortices and to the formation of solitons, straight solitary waves. Here we report the observation of a rich variety of quantum hydrodynamic effects and of the transition from superfluidity to quantum turbulence and to solitons in a flow of exciton-polaritons on the wake of a defect in a semiconductor microcavity. This has been possible thanks to the remarkable control of the fluid velocity and density of the polariton system.},

	abstract = {Abstract Fluid of a lower density and viscosity can buoyantly rise through a viscous fluid through conduits that support simple pipe flows. The conduits also support solitary waves which exhibit near soliton behavior. Laboratory experiments on the characteristics of the solitary waves and their interactions have been conducted and compared with theory. The observations of shape and phase speed of individual waves show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. Large amplitude waves traveled slightly faster than the theoretical predictions. The discrepancy is probably due to higher order effects associated with wave slope not accounted for in the theory. Individual wave characteristics (shape, amplitude and speed) were very nearly preserved after collision with another wave. A phase jump of each wave was the main consequence of an interaction. The larger (faster) waves increased in amplitude by an average of 5 percent after collision and their phase speeds decreased by an average of 4 percent. The small wave was unchanged. Numerical solutions overpredicted the magnitude of the observed phase jumps by about 40 percent when compared to the experiments. It is also shown theoretically and confirmed experimentally that the solitary waves have closed streamlines in a frame moving with the wave. Thus, transport of isolated packets of fluid over large distances will occur. Wave interactions result in the transfer of trapped fluid between the interacting waves.},

Due to recent experimental observations, thin ferromagnetic films offer a promising medium in which to study the scattering properties of two-dimensional magnetic droplet solitons, particle-like, precessing dipoles. Here, a rich set of two-droplet interaction behaviors are classified through micromagnetic simulations. Repulsive and attractive interaction dynamics are generically determined by the relative phase and speeds of the two droplets and can be classified into four types: (1) merger into a breather bound state, (2) counterpropagation trapped along the axis of symmetry, (3) reflection, and (4) violent droplet annihilation into spin wave radiation and a breather. Utilizing a nonlinear method of images, it is demonstrated that these dynamics describe repulsive/attractive scattering of a single droplet off of a magnetic boundary with pinned/free spin boundary conditions, respectively. These results explain the mechanism by which propagating and stationary droplets can be stabilized in a confined ferromagnet.},

This problem is of fundamental importance as a dispersive analogue of the corresponding classical gas-dynamics problem. Assuming the oncoming flow speed sufficiently high, we asymptotically reduce the original boundary-value problem for a steady flow past a slender body to the one-dimensional dispersive piston problem described by the nonstationary {NLS} equation, in which the role of time is played by the stretched \$x\$-coordinate and the piston motion curve is defined by the spatial body profile. Two steady oblique spatial dispersive shock waves ({DSWs}) spreading from the pointed ends of the body are generated in both half-planes. These are described analytically by constructing appropriate exact solutions of the Whitham modulation equations for the front {DSW} and by using a generalized Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule for the oblique dark soliton fan in the rear {DSW}. We propose an extension of the traditional modulation description of {DSWs} to include the linear "ship wave" pattern forming outside the nonlinear modulation region of the front {DSW}. Our analytic results are supported by direct 2D unsteady numerical simulations and are relevant to recent experiments on Bose-Einstein condensates freely expanding past obstacles.},

We use the Whitham averaging method, using a recent development of this theory for perturbed integrable equations. This general approach enables us not only to improve known results on the adiabatic evolution of isolated solitary waves and periodic wave trains in the presence of variable topography and bottom friction, modelled by the Chezy law, but also, importantly, to study the effects of these factors on the propagation of undular bores, which are essentially unsteady in the system under consideration. In particular, it is shown that the combined action of variable topography and bottom friction generally imposes certain global restrictions on the undular bore propagation so that the evolution of the leading solitary wave can be substantially different from that of an isolated solitary wave with the same initial amplitude. This non-local effect is due to nonlinear wave interactions within the undular bore and can lead to an additional solitary wave amplitude growth, which cannot be predicted in the framework of the traditional adiabatic approach to the propagation of solitary waves in slowly varying media.},

Using these results, "implosion-like" and "explosion-like" events are predicted whereby an initial hump focuses into a sharp spike which then expands into rapid oscillations. Seemingly related behavior has been observed in three-dimensional experiments and models, where a {BEC} with a sufficient number of atoms undergoes collapse.

Large droplet solitons have the approximate form of a circular domain wall sustained by precession and, in contrast to single magnetic vortices, are predicted to propagate in an extended, homogeneous magnetic medium. In this work, multiscale perturbation theory is utilized to develop an analytical framework for investigating the impact of additional physical effects on the behavior of a propagating droplet. After first developing soliton perturbation theory in the general context of Hamiltonian systems, a number of physical phenomena of current interest are investigated. These include droplet-droplet and droplet-boundary interactions, spatial magnetic field inhomogeneities, spin transfer torque induced forcing in a nanocontact device, and damping. Their combined effects demonstrate the fundamental mechanisms for a previously observed droplet drift instability and under what conditions a slowly propagating droplet can be supported by the nanocontact, important considerations for applications. This framework emphasizes the particle-like dynamics of the droplet, providing analytically tractable and practical predictions for modern experimental configurations.},

In these systems, nonlinear self-steepening competes with wave dispersion, giving rise to dispersive shock waves ({DSWs}). Example systems considered here include magma migration through the mantle as well as the buoyant ascent of a low-density fluid through a viscously deformable conduit. These flows are modelled by a third-order, degenerate, dispersive, nonlinear wave equation for the porosity (magma volume fraction) or cross-sectional area, respectively. Whitham averaging theory for step initial conditions is used to compute analytical, closed-form predictions for the {DSW} speeds and the leading edge amplitude in terms of the constitutive parameters and initial jump height. Novel physical behaviours are identified including backflow and {DSW} implosion for initial jumps sufficient to cause gradient catastrophe in the Whitham modulation equations. Theoretical predictions are shown to be in excellent agreement with long-time numerical simulations for the case of small- to moderate-amplitude {DSWs}.

This theory explains qualitatively the properties of such shocks observed in recent experiments on nonlinear dynamics of condensates of dilute alkali gases.},

	abstract = {Water-wave experiments are presented showing the evolution of finite amplitude waves in relatively shallow water when no solitons are present. In each case, the initial wave is rectangular in shape and wholly below the still water level; the amplitude of the wave is varied. The asymptotic solution of the Korteweg-de Vries ({KdV}) equation in the absence of solitons (Ablowitz \& Segur 1976) is compared with observed evolution. In addition, the asymptotic solution of the linearized {KdV} equation (a linear dispersive model) is compared with both the {KdV} solution and experiments. This comparison is a natural consequence of the fact that, in the absence of solitons, the asymptotic solutions of the {KdV} equation and its linearized version are qualitatively similar. Both the experiments and the model equations suggest that the asymptotic wave structure consists of a negative triangular wave, travelling with a speed (gh)½, followed by a train of modulated oscillatory waves which travel more slowly. Quantitative comparisons are made for the amplitude, shape and decay rate of the leading wave and the amplitude, dominant wavenumbers and velocities of the trailing wave groups. Over the parameter range of the experiments, asymptotic {KdV} theory predicts more closely the observed behaviour. The leading wave is observed to decay more rapidly than the trailing wave groups; hence the leading wave becomes less prominent with time. This is in agreement with the {KdV} solution, whereas just the opposite is predicted by linear theory. Linear predictions for the trailing wave groups are accurate only when they agree with the {KdV} predictions. Both models predict the evolution of short waves in the trailing wave region. When the short waves are unstable (k gt; 1·36), either group disintegration or focusing into envelope solitons is possible. Both of these phenomena are observed in the experiments; neither is predicted by long-wave models. The nonlinear Schrödinger equation is reviewed and tested as a model of these unstable wave groups. There is some evidence that the {KdV} equation and the nonlinear Schrödinger equation can be patched together to provide an asymptotic description of these unstable groups.},

Nonlinear waves generated downstream of an internal control became trapped in the supercritical flow.},
